adaptive_planning.py
===========
Deployment-plan definitions and the dynamic adaptive planning simulation engine.

This file contains both the user-friendly definitions of the six plans (at the top)
and the simulation engine that turns each plan into a 40-year system pathway.

SURROGATE ADAPTATION RULE
-------------------------
Students may change plan timing, costs, triggers, persistence, and lead times
without rebuilding the transport surrogate. Rebuild only when a plan change
also changes the physical transport state represented by a stage; physical
stage packages belong in stages.py, not in this file.

# 1. ADAPTIVE TRIGGERS (STUDENT-EDITABLE)
# =============================================================================
# Triggers are OPERATIONAL ACTION THRESHOLDS that initiate building a package:
#   - Signpost: the real-time operational metric being monitored
#   - Threshold: the value that indicates the current system needs an upgrade
#   - Persistence: consecutive years the threshold must be exceeded before deciding
#   - Lead time: construction/implementation duration from decision to opening
#
# MehrSpur monitors daily passenger-trips through parameters.SECTION, summed
# across the configured directions. The count includes modeled passengers and
# the optional supplementary cohort. It is distinct from all municipal-corridor
# PT trips and from the comfort-capacity thresholds used to price crowding.
# Both rules use the previous year's observations and operate independently.
# Either package can be built first, or both can be under construction together.

# Common signposts and their units. Other numeric simulate_year() result fields
# can also be monitored; a misspelled or missing result field raises an error.
# Every trigger tests STRICTLY GREATER THAN its threshold (value > threshold).
# Shares without "_trips" use passenger-kilometres (PKM), not trip counts.

# Packages and transport states are different. Edit named packages here:
#   initial_packages lists the packages already open in Year 1.
#   stations and tunnel specify when to add the respective package.
# Internally these combinations map to transport states: 0 = baseline,
# 1 = stations only, 2 = tunnel only, 3 = both packages. Either package can
# open first; adding the other produces state 3.
#
# Transition examples:
#   None                                      -> never add this package
#   {"type": "fixed", "opening_year": 9}       -> open in Year 9
#   {"type": "trigger", "trigger": "trigger1"} -> apply that trigger's rule
# Fixed years must fall within 1..N_YEARS. Trigger decisions use the previous
# year's observation; opening occurs in decision year + lead_time.
# Construction emissions are spread across that lead time, before opening.
# Fixed/initial packages use the matching DEFAULT_TRIGGERS lead time (6/10 years)
# unless their fixed rule specifies lead_time. Pre-horizon emissions are booked
# at time zero, the start of Year 1, using its carbon price.
# Costs come from parameters.py; physical effects and asset lives from stages.py.
# Names and descriptions are generated below so timing edits need only one change.
